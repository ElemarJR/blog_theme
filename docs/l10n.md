# Internationalization

To generate the theme POT file use the [l10n](https://github.com/roborourke/wp-l10n-gen) WP-CLI package created by Robert O'Rourke.

Before generate the PO file, create a backup of the current file.

	$ docker-compose run --rm php wp l10n generate --extract-from="." --extract-to="app/template/languages" --domain="elemarjr" --locale="pt_BR"

Open the backup file using the [POEdit](https://poedit.net/), click in _Catalog > Update from POT File..._ and open the new generated file. So, delete the generated file and save the backup as _pt_BR.po_. Delete the backup.
